There are two types of AI's. Predictive and Generetive AI

## Predictive

### Regression
The model output is a single continuous numeric value, such as the price of a house, sea level, or temperature.

### Classification
The model output is a category or a label. There are multiple types of classification problems:

Binary: a yes/no problem. The model outputs a single Boolean value. Spam detection is a classic example of binary classification.

Multiclass: the model outputs a single value that can take more than two discrete values. For example, in digit recognition, the output value corresponds to 10 classes (0-9).

Multilabel: the model outputs multiple discrete values. Identifying the music genres of a song is an example of this type.

### Clustering
The model outcome is a set of clusters, or groups of cases. Each case is located within a cluster. The output also includes information such as the center of each cluster and the number of elements. Clustering problems are typically solved with unsupervised learning.

## Generative AI (GenAI)
GenAI is focused on generating high-quality, realistic data, including text, images, audio, video, or code. Modern GenAI applications and models, such as Granite, LLama, ChatGPT, or Stable Diffusion, have recently emerged as industry-transforming technologies.

In GenAI, the target variables are a vector, or a matrix of continuous values. These values represent the generated content, such as the pixels of a new image. Generation problems often require powerful and large models, such as autoencoder or transformer neural networks, and the use of unsupervised learning is common.

## Reinforcement AI
In reinforcement AI, the model produces actions that an agent or a system must execute within a given environment, taking into account the state of the environment and the rewards or penalties received as a result of previous actions. This type of AI is mostly based on reinforcement learning.
