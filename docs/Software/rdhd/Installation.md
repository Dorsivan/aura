There are two methods of installation:

1. Helm Chart
2. Operator

## Opertator

As I am writing this message, the operator version is 1.4.1, provided by Red Hat officially, and requires a subscription

So far, I've used this guide - https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:deploying-and-troubleshooting-red-hat-developer-hub-openshift-practical-guide/resource/resource:deploying-and-troubleshooting-red-hat-developer-hub-openshift-practical-guide:prerequisites-and-step-by-step-guide

For operator installation

## Helm Chart

The Helm Chart is the more flexible way to install the developer hub, and my prefered way.
