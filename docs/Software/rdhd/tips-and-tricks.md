As the developer hub is based on the Backstage project, it isn't possible to understable Red Hat Developer Hub without understading Backstage properly.

The main benefits of Red Hat Developer Hub compared to Backstage are:
- Officially supported by Red Hat
- Streamlines installation and lifecycle management on Kubernetes *dramatically* 
- Simplifies a lot of the common tools of backstage. Many of the useful plugins are very easy to install, where in backstage you would normally need to perform several steps for the installation (which would be even more akward if you chose a Kubernetes installation)

However, working with the Red Hat Developer Hub introduces the following challenges:
- The documentation is sometimes incomplete. It would be more accurate to say, perhaps, that you are *required* to read the documentation of Backstage frequently to make good use of the Developer Hub.
- You can't find too much information about it online , in places like stack overflow or github issues. Probably due to the fact it is less common compared to backstage.
- It can be quite akward to support features that do not come built in. For example, if you wish to install a plugin that the Developr Hub does not already support.
