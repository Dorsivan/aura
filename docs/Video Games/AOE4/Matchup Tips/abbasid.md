### Gameplay Plan

Military Wing -> Feudal Fighting -> Castle with eco wing -> Relics, maybe 2TC here
If you are winning hard in feudal and have a timing, you can go culture wing to finish the game quickly

### General Tips

If French goes for pro scouts, you have insane pressure potential
Be careful of 2 knights opening, if you dont have 4 spears, you lose
