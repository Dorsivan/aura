## vs Zhu Xi

### Gameplay Plan

Eco wing -> Try to scout for their play, you can tell by the number on vills on gold if they are going to do pro scouts or not, and by checking for stables.

if they Zhuge Nu all in, you need to place a very safe 2nd TC that helps protect the woodline. After that you build a lot of archer and some tower to defend and add horseman after you have secured some food.

If they pro scout, place 2nd TC on deer, and go castle with some spears maybe

## vs French

### Gameplay Plan

Military Wing -> Feudal Fighting -> Castle with eco wing -> Relics, maybe 2TC here
If you are winning hard in feudal and have a timing, you can go culture wing to finish the game quickly

### General Tips

If French goes for pro scouts, you have insane pressure potential
Be careful of 2 knights opening, if you dont have 4 spears, you lose

## vs Jeanne d’Arc

### Gameplay Plan

I'm not sure, since you really want to espace the feudal age vs JD, but on the othe hand, a long feudal isn't bad for Abbasid if they go for 2TC.

I think you 2TC, play defensive with spears and try to age up. 2-3 Camel Archers can do well here.

### General Tips

If JD is melee, then 2-3 Camel Archers can run her down and target her when she goes for spears. With great micro, you can do very well here!

## vs Knights Templar

### Gameplay Plan

eco wing -> 2TC

Assuming they also 2TC:
You 2TC on a greedy place -> Castle -> Make some Lancers to harass pilgrims and vills -> 3rd TC

If they don't:
Defend with the appropriate unit and a safe 2TC. Make 2-3 horseman early to kill Pilgrims

### General Tips


## vs Holy Roman Empire

### Gameplay Plan

If they FC:
Eco wing -> 2TC on deer/berries -> Need to scout for their landmark

Burgrave -> You need to play Camel archers, get +1 range, possibly tower, macro food heavy
Regnitz -> Horseman and Spears, you need to delay relics for some time before you can age up yourself. It might also be good to trust your eco and go for Castle immediatly yourself.

If they go for Fast Imp, you can either add a 3rd TC and go Imp yourself, or try to kill with Lancers, Crossbows and Rams.

### General Tips

Walling relics can be good here.
