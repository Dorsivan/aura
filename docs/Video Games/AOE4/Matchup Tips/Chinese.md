# Chinese

## Byzantines

### Gameplay Plan

Delay Pro Scouts -> Supervise archers -> force reaction to defend berries -> Horseman -> Kill Longbows 

### General Tips

- Making early units, going for the archers and horseman pretty good if they make javalins
- Castle age timing with Knights archers
- After relics, we add a Barbican, keep dealing damage, keep harassing, play fast and defend with archers.
- They usually go for mass infantry, so NoB is very good
- Their main way of winning is with a cataphract archer timing

## Japanese

### Gameplay Plan

- Probably the hardest matchup for chinese.

If they pure FC and their gold isn't safe, ram push with spears and archers minute 8, deny gold and quickly go castle yourself
If their gold is safe, you can try the same or Turbo castle as well and hope you outplay. You will have to play safe and start farming.

- Consider Barbican on their gold if they don't have another safe gold.

### General Tips

This is a hard matchup since Japanese has equally or better castle than you do, and they will run out of food much later

Best bet is to be hyper agressive in feudal, you can make more units and keep their yumi numbers low. If they can't get a critical Yumi amount, you should be fine to tech up with an advantage.

If you manage to farm, you are somewhat equal again

## vs Sengoku Daimyo

### Gameplay Plan

Delay ps -> Go for 3 quick horseman, even more if his Yatai aren't safe -> Harass Yatai -> get pro scouts -> if they make Yari, make a few spears -> go castle quickly

Take relics and SS, don't make too many knights if they spam knights, be sure to add spears and even crossbows if you have enough spears and knights to deal with Yumi.

### General Tips

Keep trying to harass Yatai when you can.
Imperial Palace does NOT reveal Yatai (lame)
They are hard to kill and raid, so unless the map is full of food, better to use your pressure to allow the farm transition

## Abbasid
- Only civ in the game you need to go for a feudal all in versus
- Make archers, rams, and kill their TC

## Ayyubids
- Pro Scouts, depending on how much food you have
- Go for spear archer and cut their gold. Works great if they build a bunch of stables

## Chinese (mirror)
- Just play better
- Disrupt their pro scouts before going for you own.

## Zhu Xi’s Legacy
- If you can pro scouts into quick castle, this is great
- Perhpas mass archers into pro scouts into castle
- Basically you wanna get to castle
- Play Knights Crossbows

## French
- Open **spears** to protect your scouts.
- Disrupt their pro scouts.
- Horsemen are great.
- You wanna take a good fight at minute 8 and go for FC.
- Your goal is to get to castle.
- Knights spears are great in castle

## Jeanne d’Arc (JD)
- Likely **similar to French** in early behavior.
- Be careful of Jeanne abilities.

## Knights Templar
- Still a developing civ, but often go **2TC**.
- Pro Scouts, FC
- If they make units, make units and pro scouts
- Deny their pilgrims

## Holy Roman Empire (HRE)
- Your main task is to deny relics.
- Early game is pro scouts.
- Sacred sites control
- Recognize if they stay in castle or Swabia.
- If they go for Swabia, you have to do a Knights Crossbows all in with rams.

## Order of the Dragon (OOTD)
- Very similar to HRE.
- Watch out for 2TC and burgrave. In that case, Pro Scouts into FC and then Palace Guards.
- Go for a 2nd TC if they build a 2nd TC. You need to have a better economy.
- Seige is rather bad vs them.

## Delhi Sultanate
- Good matchup for Chinese
- Start spear horsemen (spears first), then go archers when needed.
- Deny their Sacred Site control.
- A Barbican on middle SS can delay their game plan significantly.
- You need to hold them with no sacred sites for about 12 minutes.
- Anticipate Castle Age, catch scholars en route to relics.
- Late game is Elephants. Bombards ayooo.
- Horsemen are good vs ranged elephants.

## English
- You can't punish them early.
- You need to scout really well vs English.
- Go for early song and a bit of units and then go castle to defend agression or white tower drop.
- You can also add your own 2nd TC.

## House of Lancaster

### Gameplay Plan

Quicky Pro Scouts -> Make units, spears, horseman at least 2 villages -> Barbican if they are very agressive and you are equal in units -> Castle

### General Tips

They are strong af, good luck

## Malians

- You play long feudal matchup and kill pit mines.

## Mongols
- Focus on **reacting to Mangudai harass**.
- In general, the way to counter Cav archers are walls, towers and seige.
- Archers with pro scouts to kill Mangudai. About 2-3 archers per Mangudai.
- Barbican on one side of the woodline and units on the other one.
- Put mill towards the wood.
- In castle you would play Knights archer.
- Trebs + Crossbows very good vs Fast Imp Mongol.
- Be careful all-ining vs Mongols that aren't actually going to imp.

## Ottomans
- Feudal **all-in could be effective**.
- Usually ottomans wants to get to imp with full military schools.
- Spears + Zhugenu for a longer feudal
- Palace Guards are effective.
- Spears are rather bad vs them due to the amount of springalds
- I think the optimal comp is Palace guards, archers and NoB

## Rus
- Harass their scouts early with fast unit production.
- Then at around minutet 7-8 you make 7 scouts and pro scouts.
- Archers in feudal to kill their scouts.
- Wall a lot.
- You should scale better after minute 20.
- **Scout the Golden Gate** to track their income plan.
- Horseman in the relic game to secure three relics. If they build knights you can go for crossbows.
