# Chinese Matchup Notes

## Byzantines
- Pro Scouts of course. sometimes you would play for delayed pro scouts
- Making early units, going for the archers and horseman pretty good if they make javalins
- Castle age timing with Knights archers
- After relics, we add a Barbican, keep dealing damage, keep harassing, play fast and defend with archers.
- They usually go for mass infantry, so NoB is very good
- Their main way of winning is with a cataphract archer timing

## Japanese
- Probably the hardest matchup for chinese.
- Ram push with Japanese to cut out they gold, archers and spears at 8 minutes, force them into yumis.
- You cut their gold and then go for your own castle age.
- Consider Barbican on their gold if they don't have another safe gold.

## Abbasid
- Only civ in the game you need to go for a feudal all in versus
- Make archers, rams, and kill their TC

## Ayyubids
- Pro Scouts, depending on how much food you have
- Go for spear archer and cut their gold. Works great if they build a bunch of stables

## Chinese (mirror)
- Just play better
- Disrupt their pro scouts before going for you own.

## Zhu Xi’s Legacy
- If you can pro scouts into quick castle, this is great
- Perhpas mass archers into pro scouts into castle
- Basically you wanna get to castle
- Play Knights Crossbows

## French
- Open **spears** to protect your scouts.
- Disrupt their pro scouts.
- Horsemen are great.
- You wanna take a good fight at minute 8 and go for FC.
- Your goal is to get to castle.
- Knights spears are great in castle

## Jeanne d’Arc (JD)
- Likely **similar to French** in early behavior.
- Be careful of Jeanne abilities.

## Knights Templar
- Still a developing civ, but often go **2TC**.
- Pro Scouts, FC
- If they make units, make units and pro scouts
- Deny their pilgrims

## Holy Roman Empire (HRE)
- Your main task is to deny relics.
- Early game is pro scouts.
- Sacred sites control
- Recognize if they stay in castle or Swabia.
- If they go for Swabia, you have to do a Knights Crossbows all in with rams.

## Order of the Dragon (OOTD)
- Very similar to HRE.
- Watch out for 2TC and burgrave. In that case, Pro Scouts into FC and then Palace Guards.
- Go for a 2nd TC if they build a 2nd TC. You need to have a better economy.
- Seige is rather bad vs them.

## Delhi Sultanate
- Good matchup for Chinese
- Start spear horsemen (spears first), then go archers when needed.
- Deny their Sacred Site control.
- A Barbican on middle SS can delay their game plan significantly.
- You need to hold them with no sacred sites for about 12 minutes.
- Anticipate Castle Age, catch scholars en route to relics.
- Late game is Elephants. Bombards ayooo.
- Horsemen are good vs ranged elephants.

## English
- You can't punish them early.
- You need to scout really well vs English.
- Go for early song and a bit of units and then go castle to defend agression or white tower drop.
- You can also add your own 2nd TC.

## The Demon Civ
- You likely can’t stop the **Manor Boom**.
- Take **all the deer** (consider **7 scouts**!) and rush Castle.
- Knights and crossbows for the relic game, then try to kill them with trebs, go for their manors.
- You can try an archer ram push. Especially if they open spears.

## Malians
- Easy matchup. 
- You just play Fast Feudal into Horseman and archers and pro scouts.
- You play long feudal matchup and kill pit mines.

## Mongols
- Focus on **reacting to Mangudai harass**.
- In general, the way to counter Cav archers are walls, towers and seige.
- Archers with pro scouts to kill Mangudai. About 2-3 archers per Mangudai.
- Barbican on one side of the woodline and units on the other one.
- Put mill towards the wood.
- In castle you would play Knights archer.
- Trebs + Crossbows very good vs Fast Imp Mongol.
- Be careful all-ining vs Mongols that aren't actually going to imp.

## Ottomans
- Feudal **all-in could be effective**.
- Usually ottomans wants to get to imp with full military schools.
- Spears + Zhugenu for a longer feudal
- Palace Guards are effective.
- Spears are rather bad vs them due to the amount of springalds
- I think the optimal comp is Palace guards, archers and NoB

## Rus
- Harass their scouts early with fast unit production.
- Then at around minutet 7-8 you make 7 scouts and pro scouts.
- Archers in feudal to kill their scouts.
- Wall a lot.
- You should scale better after minute 20.
- **Scout the Golden Gate** to track their income plan.
- Horseman in the relic game to secure three relics. If they build knights you can go for crossbows.
