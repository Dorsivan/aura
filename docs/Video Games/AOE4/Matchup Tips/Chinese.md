# Chinese Matchup Notes

## Byzantines
- They have a powerful timing attack — try to **delay it**. Longbow and Cataphracts are scary.
- Harass them early while **pro scouting**.
- Play as the **aggressor**, aiming for a **Castle Age timing attack** to finish them.
- Going into farms is **very risky** if you’re only slightly ahead.
- Pro Scouts of course
- Making early units, going for the archers and horseman pretty good if they make longbows
- Castle age timing with Knights archers

## Japanese
- If they fast castle, contest **all 3 deer packs** and go Castle yourself.
- **Song Dynasty** keeps you ahead. If they add more TCs, hit a timing to finish them.
- Consider **walling relics** early (to be evaluated).
- Probably the hardest matchup for chinese
- Ram push with Japanese to cut out they gold, archers and spears at 8 minutes, force them into yumis.

## Abbasid
- Expect **2TC boom** — go **Pro Scouts**, take deer and relics.
- Make **knights** to bait camels, then switch to the **god comp** (spears, Chokunu, Nest of Bees).
- Win with a strong **Castle Age timing**. Don't let the game go too long.

## Ayyubids
- Go **Pro Scouts**, **delay dervishes**, and head to Castle.
- Horseman are probably still the best thing to produce vs their Desert Raiders, you can get them out really quickly and run them down.
- Use **Song Dynasty** to maintain economic lead. If you are able to get into the later stages of castle, then their eco advantage will be lost.
- Knights can bait out camels, and then you switch off completely.
- Go for spear archer and cut their gold.

## Chinese (mirror)
- Just play better
- Disrupt their pro scouts before going for you own.

## Zhu Xi’s Legacy
- Disrupt their pro scouts before going for you own.
- Use **Song Dynasty** and a **defensive approach** — they’ll have to go aggressive.
- Be aware of **food exhaustion** and the danger of transitioning to farms at a bad time.
- Perhpas mass archers into pro scouts into castle
- Basically you wanna get to castle
- Play Knights Crossbows

## French
- Open **spears** to protect your scouts.
- If they commit to Feudal (scout their unit production), consider a **Barbican + Boar** secure.
- **Song Dynasty** helps you match their villager lead.
- Harass early, aim for a **Castle timing**.
- Consider **early barracks to harass gold**, delay Pro Scouts.
- Use **Imperial Officials** to speed up your own deer collection.
- Horsemen are great.
- You wanna take a good fight at minute 8 and go for FC

## Jeanne d’Arc (JD)
- Likely **similar to French** in early behavior.
- Be careful of Jeanne abilities.

## Knights Templar
- Still a developing civ, but often go **2TC**.
- Pro Scouts
- You can fast castle, grab relics, **SS**, and Song, then time a push.
- Recognize if they stay in castle or Swabia.
- If they go for Swabia, you have to do a Knights Crossbows all in with rams.
- Consider **horsemen to harass pilgrims**.
- Always use **Pro Scouts** and **protect with spears**.

## Holy Roman Empire (HRE)
- Your main task: **deny relics**.
- You get **Feudal units earlier**, so contest their pro scouting.
- **Early gold harass** (Dark Age rush) could be interesting.
- Raids and sacred site control. They are very hard to push into without IMP.

## Order of the Dragon (OOTD)
- Very similar to HRE.
- Watch out for 2TC and burgrave. In that case, Pro Scouts into FC and then Palace Guards.
- Go for a 2nd TC if they build a 2nd TC.
- Go **Pro Scouts**. If OOTD does too, counter with **archers + horsemen**.
- If they go **2TC**, harass with horsemen and **age up quickly**.
- **Controlling Sacred Sites early** forces them to move out of a defensive position.
- Seige is rather bad vs them.

## Delhi Sultanate
- Good matchup for Chinese
- Start spear horsemen (spears first), then go archers when needed.
- Deny their **Sacred Site control**.
- A **Barbican on middle SS** can delay their game plan significantly.
- **Anticipate Castle Age**, catch **scholars en route to relics**.
- Late game is Elephants. Bombards ayooo.

## English
- **Lame their closest deer** to make 2nd TC weaker.
- **Get Castle**, grab **relics + SS**, then push eco and **siege White Tower**.
- You can't punish them early.
- Go for early song and a bit of units and then go castle to defend agression or white tower drop.

## The Demon Civ
- You likely can’t stop the **Manor Boom**.
- Take **all the deer** (consider **7 scouts**!) and rush Castle.
- Knights and crossbows for the relic game, then try to kill them with trebs, go for their manors.
- You can try an archer ram push.

## Malians
- Matchup is unclear — would love community input.
- Easy matchup. 
- You just play Fast Feudal into Horseman and archers and pro scouts.
- You play long feudal matchup and kill pit mines.

## Mongols
- Focus on **reacting to Mangudai harass**.
- In general, the way to counter Cav archers are walls, towers and seige.
- Archers with pro scouts to kill Mangudai. About 2-3 archers per Mangudai.
- **Zhuge Nu** are solid vs Mangudai.
- If you scout mongol player going for Imp rush, I think you skip pro scouts, go for Barbican on the closest deer and push their base.
- If you force them off gold and they start making more units, you are actually clear to start the pro scouting / go castle.
- Trebs + Crossbows very good vs Fast Imp Mongol.
- Be careful all-ining vs Mongols that aren't actually going to imp.

## Ottomans
- Feudal **all-in could be effective**.
- **Song Dynasty + Castle Age** gives natural scaling.
- **Palace Guards** are highly effective.
- Spears are rather bad vs them due to the amount of springalds
- I think the optimal comp is Palace guards, archers and NoB

## Rus
- Harass their scouts early with fast unit production.
- Archers in feudal to kill their scouts
- Wall a lot
- You should scale better after minute 20.
- If they go **Knights**, their Castle Age will be **delayed**.
- **Scout the Golden Gate** to track their income plan.
- **God comp** is great vs Horse Archers + Knights.
- Horseman in the relic game to secure three relics. If they build knights you can go for crossbows.
- Wall up and go **Song Dynasty** for eco lead.
