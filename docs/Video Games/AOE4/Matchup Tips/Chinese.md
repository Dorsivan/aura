# Chinese

## General Tips:

- When delaying pro scouts it can be best to actually make 7 scouts once you do get it
- Barbican on boar worth, maybe even sending an IO. If you are a goat, you can remember to deposit at Barbican
- Look for dynamic places to put Barbican in that disrupt your opponent if he is too passive and you have the map control (just don't forget to get wheelbarrow)
- China is only weak at minute 18 when food runs out. Identify before if you can keep the pressure by securing both boars or extra food on certain maps. If not, you need to go for seige push or farms
- Barbican at around minute 10-14 is usually ideal. Recognize games where you need to farm and make sure you place a Barbican and start farming early to delay your weak point. 
- In castle your eco can go crazy, don't forget to rally to wood and add more production buildings.
- Tithe barns does not work on Pagoda relics
- Don't go for Yuan before you are done farming

## Byzantines

### Gameplay Plan

Delay Pro Scouts -> Supervise archers -> force reaction to defend berries -> Horseman -> Kill Longbows 

### General Tips

- Making early units, going for the archers and horseman pretty good if they make javalins
- Castle age timing with Knights archers
- After relics, we add a Barbican, keep dealing damage, keep harassing, play fast and defend with archers.
- They usually go for mass infantry, so NoB is very good
- Their main way of winning is with a cataphract archer timing

## Japanese

### Gameplay Plan

- Probably the hardest matchup for chinese.

If they pure FC and their gold isn't safe, ram push with spears and archers minute 8, deny gold and quickly go castle yourself
If their gold is safe, you can try the same or Turbo castle as well and hope you outplay. You will have to play safe and start farming.

- Consider Barbican on their gold if they don't have another safe gold.

### General Tips

This is a hard matchup since Japanese has equally or better castle than you do, and they will run out of food much later

Best bet is to be hyper agressive in feudal, you can make more units and keep their yumi numbers low. If they can't get a critical Yumi amount, you should be fine to tech up with an advantage.

If you manage to farm, you are somewhat equal again

## vs Sengoku Daimyo

### Gameplay Plan

Delay ps -> Go for 3 quick horseman, even more if his Yatai aren't safe -> Harass Yatai -> get pro scouts -> if they make Yari, make a few spears -> go castle quickly

Take relics and SS, don't make too many knights if they spam knights, be sure to add spears and even crossbows if you have enough spears and knights to deal with Yumi.

### General Tips

Keep trying to harass Yatai when you can.
Imperial Palace does NOT reveal Yatai (lame)
They are hard to kill and raid, so unless the map is full of food, better to use your pressure to allow the farm transition

## Abbasid

### Gameplay Plan

If they 2TC: ps -> horseman, archer -> lots of pressure -> castle -> timing attack with upgrades

If they 3TC: kill them in feudal

I did not try it, but if Abbasid has an exposed spawn (i.e they don't have safe food), a feudal push is logical, and an interesting fast song build for Zhugenus become relevant

### General Tips

Play tri-comp

## Ayyubids

### Gameplay Plan

- Pro Scouts, depending on how much food you have
- Go for spear archer and cut their gold. Works great if they build a bunch of stables

### General Tips

## Chinese (mirror)
- Just play better
- Disrupt their pro scouts before going for you own.

## Zhu Xi’s Legacy
- If you can pro scouts into quick castle, this is great
- Perhpas mass archers into pro scouts into castle
- Basically you wanna get to castle
- Play Knights Crossbows

## French
- Open **spears** to protect your scouts.
- Disrupt their pro scouts.
- Horsemen are great.
- You wanna take a good fight at minute 8 and go for FC.
- Your goal is to get to castle.
- Knights spears are great in castle

## Jeanne d’Arc (JD)

ps -> spears -> get to castle

## Knights Templar

If they get pilgrims, quickly make 2-3 horseman to harass. 
If they 2tc -> get ps -> castle -> SS control -> seige push

## Holy Roman Empire (HRE)
- Your main task is to deny relics.
- Early game is pro scouts.
- Sacred sites control
- Recognize if they stay in castle or Swabia.
- If they go for Swabia, you have to do a Knights Crossbows all in with rams.

## Order of the Dragon (OOTD)
- Very similar to HRE.
- Watch out for 2TC and burgrave. In that case, Pro Scouts into FC and then Palace Guards.
- Go for a 2nd TC if they build a 2nd TC. You need to have a better economy.
- Seige is rather bad vs them.

## Delhi Sultanate Sultanate

### Gameplay Plan

Feudal -> Spears -> Horseman, fight on Sacred Sites. Anticipate their castle, deny their scholars from quick relic pickup.

Early Barbican for scaling can be good here

### General Tips

You can either kill with a good timing if you have the castle faster since you should have more units, or go for farms and secure the gold, don't make too many knights.

In imp, you need to win kind of fast, before they spiral out of control. Seige push and be hard since they are likely to put a lot of keeps. Them putting keeps allows you to go for farms easier.

Horsemen are good vs ranged elephants.

## English

### Gameplay Plan

Either go for 2nd TC and play the long game, or:

PS -> 3 horseman -> castle -> SS / Seige all-in

### General Tips

## House of Lancaster

### Gameplay Plan

Delay pro scouts -> Make spears -> Get PS -> Horseman if he makes Yeoman -> If he is turbo agressive, Barbican before you age up, villages in base to keep vills safe.

### General Tips

## Malians

- You play long feudal matchup and kill pit mines.

## Mongols

### Gameplay Plan

Delay ps -> Make units -> ps -> Castle

Horseman crossbow can be a good counter to Keshik + Cav Archer, can add spears

### General Tips

- Focus on **reacting to Mangudai harass**.
- In general, the way to counter Cav archers are walls, towers and seige.
- Archers with pro scouts to kill Mangudai. About 2-3 archers per Mangudai. Horsemen can be bait.
- Barbican on one side of the woodline and units on the other one.
- Put mill towards the wood.
- In castle you would play Knights archer.
- Trebs + Crossbows very good vs Fast Imp Mongol.
- Be careful all-ining vs Mongols that aren't actually going to imp.

## Ottomans

### Gameplay Plan

ps -> try to castle quickly -> make a few knights, don't make too many! -> Add archers -> in he makes janis, move to spears -> Add NoB -> If he has too much seige, use knights or horseman to kill it, or rely on NoB

### General Tips

## Rus

### Gameplay Plan

Delay ps -> horseman quick and harass their ps -> minute 7, make like 7 scouts and take deer

- Harass their scouts early with fast unit production.
- Then at around minutet 7-8 you make 7 scouts and pro scouts.
- Archers in feudal to kill their scouts.
- Wall a lot.
- You should scale better after minute 20.
- **Scout the Golden Gate** to track their income plan.
- Horseman in the relic game to secure three relics. If they build knights you can go for crossbows.
