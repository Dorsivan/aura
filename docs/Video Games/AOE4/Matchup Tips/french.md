# French

## General Tips:

- French is a good late game civ, with cheaper units, good knights and strong trade.
- When aging up to castle, it is a good idea to send about 4 vills to stone to start getting that keep sometime soon.
- Early Guild Hall building allows you to either extend the pressure you have over the game by getting more food as food is running out in the map, or go for an imp play, even an imp keep drop.
- Red Palace in base from Guild Hall usually allows for a relatively safe farm transition

## vs Byzantine

### Gameplay Plan

Spear opening? Secret genius?

Skip pro scouts and apply heavy pressure, go to map resources early. Play Knights archers and try to find good fights. Do your best to force him to invest a lot of resources into defending his berries, this should allow you to go castle and apply more pressure.

Watch out for stables and add towers to defend vills on outside resources.

### General Tips

Archers do a good job of sniping Camel Riders.

## vs Macedonian Dynasty

### Gameplay Plan

If they hippodrom, that means they will have a lot of horseman quickly, better to keep knights near base to defend gold while massing archers, or make a few spears to keep everything secure.

### General Tips


## vs Japanese

### Gameplay Plan

Early wheelbarrow, check if they barracks. If so, send 6 to gold and get 200, then go age up and make an archer. Skip or delay pro scouts based on spawn

If they FC, make knights and break their gold and sit on it. When you have done so, quickly go castle.

I am not sure with which landmark, even Valdemar isn't sure, so I guess take stock of the game. I think Royal Institude.

### General Tips


## vs Sengoku Daimyo

### Gameplay Plan

I think you don't go for early wheelbarrow and instead go for the quick Knight opening, try to kill a Yatai or 2 before you either pro scout or try to go castle with about 5 knights and 10 archers, if you did good damage

### General Tips

## vs Ayyubids

### Gameplay Plan

Hard matchup

ps -> Knights + Archers

If they play feudal with mass Desert raiders, move to horseman, archers

### General Tips


## vs Chinese

### Gameplay Plan

Early wheelbarrow -> ps -> pressure him and try to outplay -> Castle at 12 minutes with Guild Hall -> 4-6 on stone for keep -> Relics -> try to deny the boar from him -> go for a kill on minute 18, use Guild Hall to push with more Knights, make siege.

### General Tips

You should have more units when you both run out of food thanks to Guild Hall and keep discount. That is especially true if you didn't lose vills and if he was unable to secure the boar.

Keep 2 knights there if you can spare them. After Barbican goes up, impossible to raid

## vs Jeanne d’Arc

### Gameplay Plan

Make knights, you win the long game if you don't lose more knights than he does. If he makes spears, you should too, but try to make less spears then he does and make archers to kill his spears, you will have more knights.

### General Tips

Don't rush to go castle here. Your villager eco bonus should carry you here.

## vs English

### Gameplay Plan

You can make 3 Knights into FC with Guild Hall and go for SS, depends on spawn

I think you can also 2TC yourself and go castle with Guild Hall. I think French wins the matchup in the lategame.

You can also ps -> take his deer -> take 2 boars -> go for siege push

### General Tips

If he makes a bunch of knights in castle, make arbs and knights

## vs House of Lancaster

### Gameplay Plan

ps -> Knights -> Archers -> Spears

### General Tips

You need more arhcers than usual to one shot.
This is obviously hard since HoL very good right now

## vs Malians

### Gameplay Plan

Open Knights and make archers, raid and take good fights

This depends on you being able to kill javs

### General Tips

Gotta scout well for cow amount to determine his eco situation, deny 2nd pit mine

## vs Mongols

### Gameplay Plan

Early wheelbarrow -> Scout around your base to bring back sheep and only then go and find the barracks. You can macro a bit more on gold, like 5, and you are likely to be able to gather 300 gold before needing to leave for a knight + age up.

If they Mangudai, you go for archers.
