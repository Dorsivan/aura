# Delhi Sultanate

## vs Byzantine

### Gameplay Plan

This is a good matchup imo

Ghazi and Archers. If he makes longbows go heavier on archers.

Take SS, go castle, make elephants

### General Tips


## vs Macedonian Dynasty

### Gameplay Plan

Spam Ghazi then move to archers when he makes spears

### General Tips

Try to move to castle, you don't want an extended feudal here

## vs Japanese

### Gameplay Plan

Ghazi are the best unit here.
Play for Sacred Sites and pressure, if japanese goes castle, you can keep making ghazi and wall sacred sites while castling yourself

If they spear rush

ToV -> 2 blacksmith -> Full units

### General Tips

## vs Sengoku Daimyo

### Gameplay Plan

Tough matchup. Ghazi vs Yari is fairly equal, but with Daimyo Yari are favored, and he can probably make more than you can thanks to his powerful eco. Best thing I can think of is turbo make only Ghazi to try to force him to make spears, and do your best to focus down the Yatai.

If the does no go for Ryokan you should do as many trades as you can.

### General Tips

Remember that Yari are faster than Ghazi

If Abbey and 2TC -> Make Ghazi -> Spears or archers based on opponent, and wall sites -> If they castle, you castle after walling
If Council Hall -> Gotta spam archers only at start, and add Ghazi when they start making MAA

Don't start with ghazi if the opponent makes Council Hall, macro hard pm wppd

## vs House of Lancaster

### General Tips


## vs Mongols

### Gameplay Plan

If they tower rush. go tower of victory, double blacksmith and extended feudal

If they don't, you gotta open ghazi + spearman quickly and turbo spam, skip a ghazi or 2 to make barracks and delay blacksmith. Similar to vs French

### General Tips


## vs Golden Horde

### Gameplay Plan

You need to be aggressive quickly and deal damage. Quickly make Ghazi and follow up with archers unless he makes Keshik, in which case you might need spears unless. Ghazi can deal with Torguud, and you need to kill enemy spears.

Double blacksmith later, I think with this aggressive opening you should be able to secure the control on SS early on while they are still building up. If they are making Stockyards early, I think it is a good idea to try and commit to destroy a few of them in feudal before aging up.
