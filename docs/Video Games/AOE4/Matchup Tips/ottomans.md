### Gameplay Plan

You can't open with military school

If the opponent makes Council Hall, you need 2 archery ranges, don't bother to make Mehter, since longbows will probably kill it. You can however maybe take the point that gives you 2 of them, that might be really good

If he goes for 2nd TC, just FC and go for Sipahi, be careful of making Janis since he might spam longbows after a few knights
