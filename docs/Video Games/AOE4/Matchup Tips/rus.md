## vs Abbasid

### Gameplay Plan

You can open with 3 hunting cabins
If Abbasid players chooses to 2TC, I think you skip the pro scouts and play Knights and Archers to pressure, then castle and go for the timing

### General Tips

I don't really think you can just Fast Castle here
Be wary of military wing opening, you might also want to delay pro scouts vs this opening

3 Hunting Cabins -> Feudal -> PS -> 3 horseman to defend king and harass gold if possible to delay his castle -> Go Castle -> SS and relics

Make knights in castle, if he also makes only knights, make spears, if he goes for inf, make archers and add springalds when too many MAA

Determine if you can win with SS or use it as bait to cause him to move out, and kill with siege push.
