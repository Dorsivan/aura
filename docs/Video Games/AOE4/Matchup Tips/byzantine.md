## vs Japanese

### Gameplay Plan

### General Tips

Valdemar once played spear opener as Byz vs my Japanese, I think it was a mistake, kind of allows Japanese to speedrun to castle.

I think you go for the berries at the start of the game, unless they are super safe. If they are, you can probably age up with 1 cistern for a quick archer, and do a vill pull to stop the tower from going up.

## vs Sengoku Daimyo

### Gameplay Plan

Consider opening berries into hippodrome for quick horseman and harass yatai with a quick merc camp

Longbows, go for a few quick horseman to pressure Yatai

### General Tips

Push them with Spears + Javs, you can maybe kill 2nd TC or deny resources.

### General Tips

### General Tips


## vs Zhu Xi

Be careful of a very agressive opening, tower your berries, scout for ps or no ps, and production building he makes

### General Tips


## vs French

### Gameplay Plan

Consider skipping stone in your openning to have spears faster.

Javs -> slowly secure your resources -> Make some horseman to raid him and prevent him from going on map resources for free -> Castle 

Take stock of your food situation, you may not be able to support cata production and will need to start farming instead, still playing defense.

### General Tips


## vs Jeanne d’Arc

### Gameplay Plan

Spears + Javs, be defensive and limit fights you take. Javs kill JD. You should be doing great in this matchup

### General Tips


## vs Knights Templar

### Gameplay Plan

Check if they 2tc and check the neutral market for Sipahi or Knights.

If they 2tc, try to play aggressive into a castle with Longbows. If they don't 2tc, play normally and win.

Good idea to open horseman to deny pilgrims

### General Tips


## vs Holy Roman Empire

### Gameplay Plan


### General Tips


## vs Order of the Dragon

### Gameplay Plan

I think you 2TC vs these guys if they 2tc, but I'm not sure

### General Tips

Javelins are good vs them, they kill feudal MAA and counter their strong ranged units (OOTD knights bad, archer good)

## vs Delhi Sultanate

### Gameplay Plan

Javs + Spearman ? This is probably a hard matchup.

### General Tips

Playing javs + spearman should allow you to be somewhat equal and deny SS properly. You will need to have a few horsemen to deny SS around the map.

## vs Tughlaq Dynasty

### Gameplay Plan

Scout for a fort cheese. In case you suspect it, age up quickly and make horseman, move away from your own stone to afford stable and units. Pull akritori vills to kill enemy vills before the fort is dropped. 

### General Tips

Whenever you play vs Tughlaq, always consider a fort cheese if they gather over 850 stone.

## vs English

### Gameplay Plan

I'm pretty sure you 2TC -> FC here.
On the other hand, your SS control is crazy with Mango towers, so thats also a properly good way to do it probably

### General Tips


## vs House of Lancaster

### Gameplay Plan

Spears, dunno if longbows or javs here. You can maybe just spam spears until you see him adding yeoman. Adding yeoman is usually bad for HoL in feudal.

### General Tips

I'm pretty sure Yeoman destroy longbows since they are so fast, and Javs are good for lord killing, so maybe it's Javs here.

## vs Malians

### Gameplay Plan

Winery -> 2TC -> Quickly Castle with Gold Horn Tower -> Relics -> Play defensive and get a keep on Big gold -> You have to pressure Malians player

alternatively, I've never tried it (yet) but I feel like Malians can be especially vulnerable to Cata + Cistern of the First Hill FC

### General Tips

Be wary and scout for early warrior scouts that can harass you and might limit your 2nd TC, you can add spears if there is a really good 2nd TC spot potentially

Longbows? Javs? Probably Longbows

## vs Mongols

## vs Ottomans

### General Tips


## vs Rus

### Gameplay Plan

2 on stone, 3 once you start aging up, make some spears and get to castle quickly. Go Longbows.

If he makes Knights and Archers, you should be able to defend an overwhelm with your own Cataphracts. If he goes for Knights only, you need spears. If he goes for HA, you have longbows that do well here

### General Tips

After minute 20 or so, the pressure from Rus relents as they need to start making farms. Try to deny the boar, it's very valuable to them.
