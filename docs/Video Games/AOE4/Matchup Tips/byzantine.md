## vs Malians

### Gameplay Plan

Winery -> 2TC -> Quickly Castle with Gold Horn Tower -> Relics -> Play defensive and get a keep on Big gold

alternatively, I've never tried it (yet) but I feel like Malians can be especially vulnerable to Cata + Cistern of the First Hill FC

### General Tips

Be wary and scout for early warrior scouts that can harass you and might limit your 2nd TC, you can add spears if there is a really good 2nd TC spot potentially
