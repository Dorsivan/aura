## vs Sengoku Daimyo

### Gameplay Plan

I think you should be able to fast castle, but, in case your gold is not safe, you can either:

1. Age up with 3 vill to feudal and play aggressive to harass Yatai
2. Be gigachad and go mil wing age up, which will move him into making Yari, and then go for culture wing advancement and Ghulam rush the Sengoku player.

I am not sure the ghulam rush will work because sengoku has lots of eco, but it can be a good react to a Ryokan play.

FC is probably the base play

### General Tips

Because Sengoku ages up slowly, you will be able to start the castle age up not long after they get to feudal.

Thanks to their great eco, Sengoku and flood your base with a good amount of Yari rather quickly, which can be dangerous if you decide to FC. However, you are likely to be able to gather enough for age up, then quickly make a barracks.

### Gameplay Plan

If back gold, then just fast castle probably

If the gold is not safe, then try and analyse the opponent. If he fast castles, you should too. If he goes aggressive, you will need to go aggressive as well.

consider 3 vill age up to feudal and play aggressive since HRE can have an aggressive feudal but they run out of steam

1 Dervish can nullify kings damage no problem
Make sure not to fall to Council hall, 2 archery ranges are great here, since you can move to desert raiders later
