## vs Japanese

### Gameplay Plan

4 to food, 1 build ovoo + golden tent, rally 2 to gold.

Scout for his opening, if he makes spears (and he will), you finish gathering 200 gold, and then move to wood (keep 4 on gold) then you tower to defend the ovoo, and build a ger next to the tower, sending a sheep or 2

If they fast castle after that, you play agressive with Torguud, archers and spears and push him off of gold. Prioritize archers in this case, and move to spears when the enemy age up starts.

Deny resources and go to castle slower then you usually do, since you do have "knights" and your age up is slow

## vs Abbasid

### Gameplay Plan

If they 2tc, then you play Torguud, archers, spearmen and be aggressive, force him to farm and try to make him commit a lot of resources for the food on the map, when you have a nice amount of units and can't deal too much damage, start macroing to castle with Muscovy Yasak, and push and kill after upgrades.

### General Tips


## vs Ayyubids

### Gameplay Plan

Spears, archers and Torguud, push his gold if he decides to castle up. Pressure him and deny gold, and go for castle with a nice mass of units.

If he plays feudal, add a few stockyards and go castle

Afterwards, you quickly age up to feudal and try to play to extend the feudal, raiding a lot and adding stockyards when you can, aging up when you have the advantage.
