- **Result:** Loss
- **Game Duration:** 25 minutes

## Opening Strategy
Normal build order, going for heavy pro scouts into castle rush, making no units.
In castle go for knights and take relics. Crossbows to deal with Demilancers.

## Opponent Strategy
6 manors into castle.
Make nothing but hobelars with upgrades and charge them into the base.

## What Went Well
- Took 3 deer packs.
- Took 4 relics.
- Had a nice small harassment.

## What Went Wrong
- No scouting resulting in me making the wrong unit comp.
- When the opponent wasn't contesting relics upon reaching castle, I should have checked him.
- Could have built a Barbican and a few towers in the base to keep most of the villagers.
- Send a few villagers to boar earlier

## What Should Be Done In The Future
- Scouting when the opponent isn't playing into the relic phase
- More scouting in feudal. Probably should always keep at least one scout near enemy.
