## Opening Strategy
Normal build order, going for barracks in feudal into 4 spears and then pro scouts.
I saw opponent with many villagers on gold and a tower and assumed a FC, so I took as many deer as I could

## Opponent Strategy
Late pro scouts with a few palace guards to defend them.
Feels like the opponent just played a very messy game.

## What Went Well
- Took 3 deer packs.
- Killed 3 of his scouts and disrupted his pro scouting.
- Good scouting and decision making.

## What Went Wrong
- 

## What Should Be Done In The Future
- I need to check the resources split into castle and if it was good
