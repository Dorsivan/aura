- **Result:** Loss
- **Game Duration:** 24 minutes

## Opening Strategy
Pro scouting into FC

## Opponent Strategy
King into FC, building some early farms

## What Went Well
- Got 4 relics
- I think starting with scouts and then spears is correct vs English king, with good micro you get one trip back home no problem
- Scouted well, knew he was going for FC due to all of the vills on gold

## What Went Wrong
- Had insane food float in early game, which delayed making spears massively
- Lost gold vill like a dent for no reason
- over made spears, need no more than 2-3.
- Didnt Pro Scouts his deer as a response to him FC
- I got spooked by his FC macro, I was certain he will do a white tower drop.
- I should have made a single horseman to harass his gold vills, delaying him and forcing him to make towers.
- 

## What Should Be Done In The Future
- Right now, I think the correct thing was to get pro scouts and go for his deer immediatly with a bunch of couts, taking them and then taking the corner deer.
- After that, go to castle and take a bunch of relics.
- Since this map has small golds and I have imperial palace, there are many places to harass.
- Since I took so much deer, perhaps I should have went for the second town cetner to catch up with his 2nd TC.
- Alternately, I should have gone to try and kill his 2nd TC.
