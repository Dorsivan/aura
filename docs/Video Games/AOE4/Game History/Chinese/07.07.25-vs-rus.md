- **Result:** Loss
- **Game Duration:** 17 minutes

## Opening Strategy
Pro Scouts no units into FC taking Relics and booming

## Opponent Strategy
Make some Knights to harass my scouts and pro scouts into FC and HA

## What Went Well
- I took my deer, made a bit of spears to react to his knights, took my deer no problem
- Took 4 relics
- Good Barbican placement
- Remembered to put some towers

## What Went Wrong
- Main reason I lost was I had big food and gold floats but no wood, so I had no production buildings.
- I made knights which was a mistake, I probably should have made much more horsemen.
- I made zhugenus which was great, but I didn't have a response to him going for crossbows and knights
- My comp should have been horsemen and crossbows I think.
- I took terrible fights for no reason, I pushed into the opponent though there was no reason

## What Should Be Done In The Future
- I should have stuck to my original plan, making a bunch of towers and walls, getting another TC, booming with the insane amount of food I have
- Remain on the defensive, wall up, not lose vills to raids
- I took the wrong landmark, should have been Imperial Palace
