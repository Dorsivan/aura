## Opening Strategy
Normal opening, reacting to his early spears, speed building archers.

## Opponent Strategy
Early barracks rush (mistake). Place tower on gold then trying to tower on the mill.
He then put arrowslits on the tower.

## What Went Well
- Killed his 3 spears
- Had good resource management at the start

## What Went Wrong
- Should have researched horticulture.
- I sent archers forward without the scout, very stupid, this actually probably lost the push by itself.
- Even after I had sent the scouts, I did not use it properly.
- If I had clicked the stone I would have seen he went for second TC
- Overmade spears
- Lost units to arrowslits tower for no reason
- Lost units due to bad decision making and comp

## What Should Be Done In The Future
- Much much more archers than spears.
- Use scouts wisely
