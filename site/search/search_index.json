Therefore, it is unusual to have SELinux access problems with common RHEL services when they are configured correctly. SELinux access problems occur when services are implemented incorrectly, or when new applications have incomplete policies. Consider these troubleshooting concepts before making broad SELinux configuration changes.</p> <p>Most access denials indicate that SELinux is working correctly by blocking improper actions.</p> <p>Evaluating denied actions requires some familiarity with normal, expected service actions.</p> <p>The most common SELinux issue is an incorrect context on new, copied, or moved files.</p> <p>File contexts can be fixed when an existing policy references their location.</p> <p>Optional Boolean policy features are documented in the _selinux man pages.</p> <p>Implementing Boolean features generally requires setting additional non-SELinux configuration.</p> <p>SELinux policies do not replace or circumvent file permissions or access control list restrictions.</p> <p>When a common application or service fails, and the service is known to have a working SELinux policy, first see the service's _selinux man page to verify the correct context type label.

It would be more accurate to say, perhaps, that you are required to read the documentation of Backstage frequently to make good use of the Developer Hub. - You can't find too much information about it online , in places like stack overflow or github issues. Probably due to the fact it is less common compared to backstage. - It can be quite akward to support features that do not come built in.
